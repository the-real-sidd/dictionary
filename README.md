#Online Dictionary Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v>
#### Description:
I built this online dictionary using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used the free Dictionary API to fetch the Meaning, example and Synonyms of the word which user type in the Search Field.

You can search any word by just typing into the search field or by taping on the mic icon to activate voice seach in the Search Field.

After taping on the mic icon, Voice search will be activated and the word you say will be taken as the Search Query.

After you said the word you want to find the meaning of, it'll start fetching the Dictionary API for the data. And the JavaScript will convert the JSON output into the presentable data on the web page.

When you find the meaning, example and synonyms of the word, you can tap on any word from the synonyms to search that word. The word you'll click will then taken as the search query to fetch the dictionary.

you can also see the demo on <https://the-real-sidd.github.io/dictionary/> or the same code is hosted on personal website as well, accessible at <https://therealsidd.com/dictionary/>

Thank you so much!

This was CS50!
